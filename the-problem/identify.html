          How can we improve it?<br><br>

          I understand that the whole intention of these new Wayfinding system is to make wayfinding, well,
          easier. But how much simpler can these signs go? <br><br> As quoted by the designer himself, he said:
        </p>
        <blockquote
          cite="https://www.lasalle.edu.sg/features/conversation-samuel-lim-redesigning-singapores-subway-signage">
          “It means that our redesign, in this instance, has failed, because people can’t even see the signage
          hanging up there above,” said Lim, who works at the Land Transport Authority (LTA), a government
          agency
          that oversees the signage system of Singapore’s Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system.</blockquote>

        <p class="summary">
          In my opinion, while it is true that it somehow failed, to salvage them is actually possible.
          Believe it or not, it just needed something. Yep, it's text. To dive in deeper, let's take a look at
          the different
          parts the new Wayfinding system did wrong.

          I applaud the small effort of text in the icons, later added on the signages for Bus Interchanges
          (mainly Woodlands ITH, and the new Tampines North Bus Int), but it is not enough.

          So why not solve these once and for all - Bring the Exit Directories to the Platforms too. But before
          doing that, the Exit Directory list itself needs some minor tweaking too. This is how the current Exit
          Directories look <mark class="yellow">(Fig. 10)</mark>. As seen here, the Exit Numbers are all not in order, as it is sorted
          according to the place's Alphabetical Order. <br><br>
          As a user myself, if I'm too lazy to use Google Maps, or when I forget to bring my Mobile Devices
          (sometimes it happens), I would refer to the Exit Directories. You can’t deny that using Google Maps
          would be faster and easier, because I won't even need to check the Directories as it quickly tells me
          which Exits to take <mark class="yellow">(Fig. 11)</mark>. <i>As you can also see, both the Exit Directory and Google Maps could
            not agree on
            which Exits to take, but that is a different story for another day. <br><br></i>

          But if you were to actually refer to the Exit Directories, the list is currently is very overwhelming
          to see - well, probably because it was arranged in alphabetical order. In my opinion, I would prefer
          the lists to be arranged in Exit Number/Letter order. <br><b>You can see how I'd envision it to be
            improved, in the Solutions section, below.

        <h3 class="summary-tit">Part 3: Consistencies, as a whole</h3><br>
        <p class="summary">
          Consistencies is a key to good design system. The current signage design is almost there, but some
          parts are not consistent. A most notalbe examples is the Exit Letters/Numbers. TEL uses Numbers (Exit
          1,2,3 etc), while the rest still uses Letters. Rales Place particularly, began the changeout to the
          new current signage design, but retained the Exit Letters. This may confuse some people, but I also
          understood why it was done. Change to numbers - may confuse existing people using the exits, retain
          the letters, while i minimises confusion, may lead to inconsistencies. In my opinion, they SHOULD
          change to numbers, and the LTA should also start consolidating exits to make it simpler. <br>
